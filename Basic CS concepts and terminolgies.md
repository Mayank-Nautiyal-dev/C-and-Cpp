## Advanced Computer Fundamentals – Technical Overview

📘 What is a Computer?
A computer is a programmable electronic system that takes raw input (data), processes it using a defined set of instructions (program), and produces meaningful output. It’s composed of three main domains:

Computation (Processing Units)

Memory & Storage

Networking

🧠 A. Computation
A.1 CPU – Central Processing Unit
The CPU executes instructions and coordinates activities between all other components. It performs the fetch-decode-execute cycle for processing machine instructions.

📌 Example Instruction Flow (Pseudocode):

assembly 
```
Copy
Edit
MOV AX, 01h     ; Load value into register
ADD AX, 02h     ; Add value to register
```
A.2 DPU – Data Processing Unit
DPUs handle data-centric operations like encryption, compression, and packet parsing. Used in cloud computing, data centers, and zero-trust networking.

🔧 Example Use Case: Offloading SSL/TLS encryption from CPU to DPU for performance optimization.

A.3 GPU – Graphics Processing Unit
GPUs are massively parallel processors for vectorized math operations. Extensively used in:

Graphics rendering

Deep Learning

Video encoding/decoding

🧠 Example: Python with TensorFlow (GPU Training)

python
```
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])
    b = tf.constant([3.0, 4.0])
    result = tf.add(a, b)
```
A.4 APU – Accelerated Processing Unit
Combines CPU + GPU on a single chip. Ideal for ultrabooks and integrated graphics scenarios (e.g., AMD Ryzen APUs).

🖼️ Example Use Case: Lightweight gaming or video editing without a discrete GPU.

A.5 NPU – Neural Processing Unit
Dedicated AI chips for neural inference and edge AI (e.g., smartphone camera recognition, voice assistants).

📲 Used in: Huawei Kirin chips, Apple Neural Engine.

A.6 TPU – Tensor Processing Unit
Designed by Google, optimized for matrix operations (used in deep learning models).

🏗️ Use Case: Training large-scale models like BERT, GPT, etc.

A.7 FPGA – Field-Programmable Gate Array
Reconfigurable ICs tailored for specific logic flows.

📈 Use Case: Real-time analytics in high-frequency trading.

📦 Example Logic in Verilog:

verilog
```
always @(posedge clk)
  if (reset)
    counter <= 0;
  else
    counter <= counter + 1;
```
A.8 ASIC – Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
Hardwired chips designed for a single task (e.g., Bitcoin mining via SHA-256).

🧮 Use Case: ASICs used in Bitmain AntMiner for cryptocurrency.

A.9 CISC vs. A.10 RISC
CISC: Complex, fewer lines of code (e.g., Intel x86)

RISC: Simple instructions, faster execution (e.g., ARM)

📦 Example:

assembly
```
; CISC
MULT AX, BX

; RISC
LOAD R1, A
LOAD R2, B
MUL R3, R1, R2
```
A.11 RISC-V
An open-source instruction set enabling customizable processors.

🧪 Example: Used in low-power IoT devices or academic CPUs.

A.12 SoC – System on Chip
Single-chip solutions including CPU, GPU, memory controllers, and I/O. Examples:

Snapdragon (Qualcomm)

Apple M1/M2

🧬 B. Memory and Storage
B.1 Primary Memory
RAM: Temporary, volatile.

Cache: CPU-integrated fast memory (L1, L2, L3).

🔁 Example:

c
```
int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Stored in RAM during runtime
    return 0;
}
```
B.2 Secondary Storage
Non-volatile storage:

HDD, SSD, NVMe

Use case: Permanent storage for files, OS, and media.

💾 Example with Python File Write:

python
```
with open("data.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Stored on secondary storage")
```
🌐 C. Networking
C.1 Internet
Global network using TCP/IP protocols. Supports billions of connected devices.

C.2 DNS
Maps domain names to IP addresses.

🔍 Example:

bash
```
nslookup openai.com
```
C.3 IP Addressing
IPv4: 32-bit, e.g., 192.168.1.1

IPv6: 128-bit, e.g., 2001:0db8::1

🌐 Private Ranges:

192.168.x.x

10.x.x.x

172.16.x.x – 172.31.x.x

C.4 MAC Address
Unique NIC identifier (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)

C.5 Ports
Used to route traffic to applications.

🖧 Example:

HTTP → Port 80

SSH → Port 22

C.6 OSI Model

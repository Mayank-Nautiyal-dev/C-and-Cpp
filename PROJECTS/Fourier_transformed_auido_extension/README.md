# Dynamic Fourier Transform Audio Enhanced (D-FTA)

## Overview

Dynamic Fourier Transform Audio Enhanced (D-FTA) is an innovative audio compression system that uses advanced signal processing techniques to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining audio quality. Unlike traditional audio codecs that work in the time domain or use static frequency analysis, D-FTA employs adaptive windowing and dynamic Fourier transform analysis to represent audio as a collection of sine wave components.

## Core Technologies and Techniques

### 1. Adaptive Windowing
- **Dynamic Window Sizing**: Automatically adjusts FFT window size based on signal complexity
- **Signal Complexity Analysis**: Uses energy and zero-crossing metrics to determine optimal window size
- **Overlapping Windows**: 50% overlap between analysis windows for smooth reconstruction

### 2. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- **Radix-2 FFT Implementation**: Custom optimized FFT with bit-reversal permutation
- **Hann Windowing**: Applied to reduce spectral leakage during frequency analysis
- **Power-of-2 Optimization**: Automatic padding to nearest power of 2 for efficient computation

### 3. Frequency Domain Representation
- **Sine Wave Decomposition**: Audio represented as discrete sine wave components
- **Component Storage**: Each component stores frequency, amplitude, phase, start time, and duration
- **Integer Quantization**: Amplitude and phase stored as scaled integers for space efficiency

### 4. Advanced Filtering and Optimization
- **Frequency Filtering**: Removes components outside human audible range (20 Hz - 20 kHz)
- **Amplitude Thresholding**: Eliminates perceptually insignificant low-amplitude components
- **Phase Optimization**: Removes opposite-phase components that cancel each other
- **Similarity Filtering**: Merges similar frequency components to reduce redundancy

### 5. File Format (FTAE)
- **Custom Binary Format**: Optimized for sine wave component storage
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains original sample rate, duration, and compression settings
- **Version Control**: Format versioning for future compatibility
